In the mining sector, the pandemic has had devastating effects on workers and communities around the world. In some parts of Africa, Asia, and Latin America, small-scale mining activity has been reduced or halted due to lockdowns and blocked trade routes. Where mining has been suspended, mine workers and their families have lost their income. Where mining has continued, workers and affected communities have been exposed to increased risks to their human rights. In some small-scale mining areas, child labor has risen.\n","In addition, some illegal mine operators and traders have made use of the Covid-19 pandemic to expand their unlawful small-scale mining activities. Illegal gold mining in Africa and Latin America threatens the environment and rights protections, especially the rights of Indigenous peoples. And while lockdowns have been important in combatting the spread of the pandemic, they have also hampered government monitoring and enforcement of mining and labor rights standards. Finally, industrial mines have become hotspots for Covid-19, including the world’s deepest gold mine, located in South Africa.\n","The Covid-19 pandemic has also posed vast challenges for the jewelry and watch industry, a major market for gold, diamonds, and other minerals. Jewelry companies have had to close stores, and consumer demand has slumped. Companies that were investing in responsible sourcing have diverted attention and resources to more immediate crisis management measures. But now more than ever, because of the increased risk of abuse, jewelry companies should conduct human rights due diligence to ensure that they do not cause or contribute to rights abuses in their supply chains. To achieve this they should comply with the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (the “UN Guiding Principles”) and a sector-specific norm for mineral sourcing, the Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict-Affected and High-Risk Areas by the Organization for Economic Development and Cooperation (the “OECD Minerals Guidance”). Such human rights due diligence should include steps to prevent and address environmental harm and risks from climate change, given their foreseeable impact.\n","This report scrutinizes and ranks 15 major jewelry companies for their efforts to prevent and address human rights abuses in their gold and diamond supply chains between 2018 and 2020, following up on Human Right Watch’s 2018 report, “The Hidden Cost of Jewelry.” The report also assesses the role of broader industry initiatives, including certification standards.\n","The 15 companies featured in this report have been selected to include some of the industry’s largest and best-known jewelry and watch companies from different markets: Boodles (United Kingdom), Bulgari (Italy), Cartier (France), Chopard (Switzerland), Chow Tai Fook (Hong Kong), Christ (Germany), Harry Winston (United States), Kalyan (India), Mikimoto (Japan), Pandora (Denmark), Rolex (Switzerland), Signet (United States), Tanishq (India), Tribhovandas Bhimji Zaveri Ltd. (TBZ)(India), and Tiffany & Co. (US). Thirteen of the companies were first assessed by Human Rights Watch in 2018 and have been evaluated for their progress made since publication of our initial report. Two companies, Mikimoto and Chow Tai Fook, were added to this assessment to extend the report’s geographic scope to Japan, Hong Kong, and China. While these 15 companies are not representative of the entire industry, collectively they generate more than US$40 billion in annual revenue, about 15 percent of global jewelry sales.  \n","Overall, the report finds that there has been some progress in individual company practice and in industry standard-setting since 2018. Still, most companies assessed fall short of meeting international norms, and existing certification schemes lack rigor and transparency. In short, much more needs to be done to assure consumers that the jewelry they buy is sourced responsibly.\n","On the positive side, 11 of the 15 companies assessed have taken some steps to improve their human rights due diligence since the publication of our 2018 report. Eight of the fifteen companies assessed in this report have taken some steps to enhance traceability of their gold or diamonds. Some have opted to source only recycled gold, thus avoiding risks related to mined gold of unknown origin. Several companies have strengthened their supplier codes of conduct, more rigorously screened their suppliers, or published their requirements of suppliers for the first time. Some now publicly identified their suppliers. In addition, 10 companies assessed have taken steps to disclose publicly more information on their due diligence in ensuring respect for human rights. While the steps taken by individual companies vary greatly, and some companies are still performing poorly, these efforts demonstrate progress.\n","Several industry initiatives have also progressed since 2018. For example, the Responsible Jewelry Council (RJC), the main jewelry industry association, has brought its main certification standard in line with the OECD Minerals Guidance. The Fairtrade and Fairmined Gold standards, which have successfully certified artisanal and small-scale gold mines, are popular with small jewelers and some bigger companies. A new, robust standard for responsible mining has been launched by the Initiative for Responsible Mining Assurance. In addition, several industry initiatives are underway to use technology—such as blockchain and laser technology—to ensure full traceability of diamonds and other minerals. Overall, many players in the sector are recognizing the need to respond to increased consumer demand for responsible and transparent sourcing, as well as to demands and requirements by governments for responsible company conduct.\n","On the negative side, some of the companies have serious gaps in their due diligence on human rights and transparency. For example, most jewelry companies are still not able to trace their gold and diamonds to the mines of origin. Many do not conduct thorough human rights assessments or mitigation measures regarding conditions at the mines of origin or elsewhere in the supply chain. This is a serious gap, given the legacy of human rights abuses in gold and diamond mining generally, and the renewed human rights risks linked to the Covid-19 pandemic. In the context of the pandemic, few companies appear to have reassessed their supply chains for renewed risks, or actively taken steps to protect the rights of workers in their supply chains. Most companies also do not report on their due diligence efforts to respect human rights in detail. Notably, the vast majority of companies assessed do not report on the human rights risks identified, mitigating actions taken, or non-compliances found. None publish audit reports.\n","Furthermore, four companies assessed disclose almost no information to the public about their approach to responsible sourcing. This lack of transparency contravenes international norms and standards on best business practice, and diverges from the industry trend described above. When companies do not disclose any information about their practices, it becomes impossible for consumers, the general public, or affected mining communities to assess their actions, and corporate accountability is harder to establish.\n","Although certification standards should set a high standard, they have not always done so. For example, standards by the main jewelry industry group, the RJC, or the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme and the World Diamond Council’s System of Warranties Guidelines do not require full traceability, transparency, or robust on-the-ground human rights assessments from their members. Third-party audits of jewelry supply chains are often conducted remotely, and auditors sometimes lack human rights expertise. While some industry standards, such as the RJC and the London Bullion Market Association (LBMA), require companies to report about their human rights due diligence efforts, they do not mandate the publication of audit reports or instances of non-compliance found. Their own implementation and certification processes lack transparency, too: The roll-out of the 2019 RJC standard, for example, is planned over a multi-year period, and its certification process is opaque. About 30 percent of RJC members also have the reputational benefit of being members without having completed certification.\n","Voluntary standards can play a role in generating dialogue and supporting companies that seek to develop best practice. But they cannot replace legal requirements, as our findings confirm. Ultimately, only mandatory human rights due diligence rules—laws—will create a level playing field and move the whole industry in the right direction.\n","***\n","For this report, Human Rights Watch sent letters to the 15 companies profiled, requesting information about their policies and practices in relation to human rights due diligence and the sourcing of their gold and diamonds. Nine companies responded in writing to Human Rights Watch’s letters requesting information regarding their policies and practices with regard to sourcing: Boodles, Bulgari, Cartier, Chopard, Chow Tai Fook, Pandora, Signet, Tanishq, and Tiffany & Co. The company responses varied widely, with some providing detailed information on their policies and practices in writing, while others provided only general information on their approach to sourcing. Five companies that responded to Human Rights Watch also spoke to us via conference call: Boodles, Bulgari, Pandora, Signet, and Tiffany & Co. Human Rights Watch also requested information from these companies regarding their response to Covid-19. Six companies did not reply to several requests for information on their Covid-19 response: Christ, Harry Winston, Kalyan, Mikimoto, Rolex, and TBZ.\n","We assessed the companies for their human rights due diligence measures taken between 2018 and 2020, based on the information provided to Human Rights Watch directly, as well as publicly available information. Since very little information was available on Kalyan, Mikomoto, Rolex, and TBZ, we could not rank these four companies. Below is the ranking that summarizes our findings:\n","To move forward, all jewelry companies need to put in place strong human rights safeguards—otherwise, they risk contributing to human rights abuses. In particular, companies should:\n","Certification schemes and responsible sourcing initiatives—including the Responsible Jewellery Council and the World Diamond Council—should set and uphold a high industry standard and ensure they do not give legitimacy to companies that do not deserve it. Such initiatives should:\n","As governments develop legislation on supply chain due diligence, they should require proper human rights assessments, prevention, mitigation, and remedy, and full transparency in supply chains. Membership in a certification standard, such as the RJC or LBMA, should not automatically exempt companies from their obligations or penalties under the law, as is currently planned or debated in several jurisdictions.

diamond and colored gemstone companies have been granted a “pilot period” with additional time to reach compliance, after diamond industry companies or groups pushed for this exception[106]: Between April 2020 and April 2021, companies in the diamond and gemstone supply chain will be assessed for some, but not all of the Code’s requirements—notably, they will not be checked for steps 3 and 4 of the OECD Minerals Guidance which require companies to identify and address human rights risks and undergo a third-party audit. Therefore, Human Rights Watch was unable to determine whether the remaining companies have codes for their suppliers.Traceability: Very few companies can trace all their mined gold or diamonds back to the mines of origin, ensuring full chain of custody in order to reliably assess whether their materials are free from abuse. [226] The Code of Conduct mostly deals with business ethics and professional behavior, but also briefly touches on labor rights.Christ does not publish information on the origin of its gold or diamonds, its assessment of or response to human rights risks, or the names of its suppliers.Harry Winston, founded in 1932, is a luxury jeweler and watchmaker. Both the Kimberley Process and the associated World Diamond Council System of Warranties Guidelines for companies have proven insufficient to ensure robust human rights due diligence in the diamond supply chain.The Kimberley Process relies on a narrow “conflict diamond” definition that only focuses on rough diamonds sold by rebel groups seeking to overthrow a legitimate government, ignoring a wide range of human rights issues related to state actors or private security firms. [156] In April 2019, likely in response to some of the criticism, De Beers publicly stated that its diamonds originate from the Diamond Trading Company (a subsidiary), and the Diamond Trading Company then launched a new website with information on human rights issues checked at each of its eight mines of origin. [57] The regulation directly applies to EU importers of the four metals, but will also have an impact on refiners and smelters who supply the importers; the EU will draw up a list of refiners and smelters considered “responsible.” While the regulation does not apply to downstream companies such as jewelry companies, such companies are still “expected to use reporting and other tools to make their due diligence more transparent, including, for many large companies, those in the non-financial reporting directive.”[58]Money-laundering, fraud, bribery, and tax evasion have been connected to human rights abuses in the mineral supply chain, and measures against financial crime are part of the OECD Minerals Guidance. Ultimately, only legislation will be able to create a level playing field and prompt all businesses to conduct robust human rights due diligence.The Responsible Jewellery Council (RJC) is the leading jewelry industry association, with over 1,200 member companies along the jewelry supply chain, including small-scale and industrial mines, traders, gold refiners, diamond cutters and polishers, manufacturers, and jewelry retailers. The majority of the companies assessed are still not able to trace their gold and diamonds to the mines of origin, and thus do not undertake human rights assessments or mitigation measures regarding conditions prevailing at these mines.Although most of the companies provide information to the public regarding their sourcing practices and responded to Human Rights Watch’s requests for information, four of the fifteen companies—Kalyan, Mikimoto, Rolex, and TBZ—are highly untransparent: they disclose almost no information to the public about their approach to responsible sourcing and did not answer any of Human Rights Watch’s letters and emails for this report.Below is a summary of findings regarding some of the key criteria for Human Rights Watch’s assessments:Supplier Codes of Conduct: Eight of the fifteen companies assessed (or the relevant parent company) have a public supplier code of conduct, though the codes vary in how well they incorporate international standards. [258] The company worked with the Responsible Artisanal Gold Solutions (RAGS) Forum, a multi-stakeholder initiative on artisanal gold to help Nyamurhale, a mine once occupied by non-state armed groups, to improve working conditions, address human rights issues, and ensure full traceability from the mine site to the retailer. [157] While the website includes a summary of audits under the Best Practice Principles, it lacks detail and does not allow for traceability of diamonds from industrial mines.Russia-based Alrosa is the world’s largest diamond mining company by volume, accounting for 26 percent of global diamond production (by carats). Chain of custody and traceability are essential for conducting human rights due diligence—if a company does not know where its material is from, it cannot assess or address human rights risks.The Chain of Custody Standard promotes traceability by ensuring documentation along the supply chain and requiring information on the country of origin for mined gold, silver, and platinum metals. [206] Chow Tai Fook has undertaken steps towards responsible sourcing, but is in the weak category of Human Rights Watch’s ranking.The company has a public supply chain policy as well as a Code of Practices for Supplier Assessment, both of which cover human rights, business ethics, environment, and other issues; it also has several sections on diamond supply chains specifically. [229] In late 2018, the Swatch Group announced that it had full traceability for its “entire gold processing chain.” [230] It strives to keep its supply chain as short as possible, sourcing its gold exclusively from mines in the United\\xa0States, Canada, or Australia, and sending it directly to the Swatch Group’s in-house foundry, Nivarox-FAR in Switzerland. [121] As a result of this and significant concerns with implementation and enforcement, the scheme appears increasingly dysfunctional and has lost credibility as a safeguard against the abusive mining of diamonds.The World Diamond Council (WDC), a business association for the diamond industry focused exclusively on the KP, has published guidelines for industry self-regulation in order to “strengthen consumer confidence in diamonds” whether in rough or polished form. Tanishq also says it is planning to source rough diamonds only from large-scale mining companies, after a 2018 visit to an Alrosa mine where the company found “acceptable” labor practices. Regrettably, two companies – Signet and Cartier – no longer published their gold or diamond suppliers in 2020, despite having done so previously.Sourcing and support for the artisanal sector: Artisanal mines provide income for millions of workers and thousands of mining communities. In the diamond and gold supply chain, artisanal and small-scale mining operations may not have access to the new technology or reliable internet, or may not be included in relevant mine databases, and as a result could be disadvantaged. [146] While this would not provide details on human rights risks or non-compliances found and addressed, IRMA’s reporting requirements may provide more transparency than most other standards.The scope of the standard is limited to industrial mines, but other actors in the mineral supply chain—such as jewelry companies—can choose to source from IRMA-certified mines to reduce human rights risk; this would not, however, relieve them from their duty to conduct their own human rights assessments.Human rights abuses continue to occur in the context of gold and diamond mining, despite the existence of numerous voluntary standards for responsible business conduct. [167] The company has improved its responsible sourcing practices since 2018 and is now in the fair category of Human Rights Watch’s ranking.Boodles previously had only a confidential Code of Conduct for its diamond suppliers. The company states on its website that it adheres rigorously to both the Kimberley Process and the World Diamond Council\\'s voluntary System of Warranties and states that “all our diamonds are conflict-free.”[238]Mikimoto provides no other information regarding its human rights due diligence or the names of its suppliers. It is not limited to conflict regions but applies to all areas that are “high-risk,” such as areas of political instability, repression, institutional weakness, insecurity, collapse of infrastructure, widespread violence, violations of national or international law, or “other risks of harm to people.”[55] The OECD Minerals Guidance also applies to all actors in the supply chain; for gold, it distinguishes between “upstream” companies such as mines, gold traders in the country of origin, and international gold refiners, and “downstream” companies, such as international gold traders, bullion banks, jewelers, and other retailers. It lays out five steps for risk-based due diligence in the minerals supply chain, including jewelry companies: 1) strong management systems, including systems to establish chain of custody; 2) identification and assessment of risks in the supply chain; 3) a strategy to respond to identified risks; 4) third-party audits of supply chain due diligence; and 5) public reporting on supply chain due diligence.The OECD Minerals Guidance applies to the sourcing of all minerals, including diamonds, and implicates a broad range of human rights. [125]Gold refineries have a unique opportunity to establish traceability and conduct human rights due diligence in their supply chain, as they receive gold from various sources but then usually mix it during the refining process. [138] As a consequence, most buyers of the gold are small jewelers; larger companies report that available quantities are not sufficient for their needs.A number of initiatives seek to assist mines that are working towards compliance with human rights and environmental standards, including support programs from nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and an open-source standard for responsible artisanal and small-scale mining, developed by ARM. Human Rights Watch does not have any information on jewelry brands taking steps to protect workers in supplier factories from the economic impacts of the pandemic.Some companies pivoted to meet specific Covid-19-related demand. [155] The Best Practice Principles cover a wide range of issues, including business ethics, human rights, environment, and mining.De Beers aggregates diamonds from multiple mines before selling them to other businesses, and therefore does not provide buyers with information regarding the specific mines of origin. [30]There has also been an increase in illegal gold and diamond mining and trading in several countries in Africa and Latin America, in part due to restrictions on the legal movement of resources and reduced government monitoring of laws and regulations. [113] But it does not require companies to trace their metal back to the mines of origin—only to the country of origin— nor does it require companies to make any of that information public or conduct full human rights due diligence. While Bulgari and Cartier say they increasingly source gold certified under the Chain of Custody Standard from recycled sources, traceability remains a concern for any mined gold.With regard to diamonds, few companies have traceability to the mine of origin since the major diamond mining companies do not provide this information. [148] But the majority of countries still lack laws requiring all business actors to conduct robust human rights due diligence.For this report, Human Rights Watch sent letters to the 15 companies profiled below requesting information about their policies and practices in relation to human rights due diligence and the sourcing of their gold and diamonds. In response to questions regarding these areas, the company responded that it cannot disclose further details “in the interests of protecting our employees and business partners, as well as our production sites and manufacturing processes.”[203]Chow Tai Fook Jewellery Group is a Hong Kong-based Chinese company with approximately $8.5 billion in annual revenue. As a result of its risk assessment, the company stated that it decided not to source from five countries for risk of armed conflict, human rights abuse, and corruption, and published the names of these countries in an “exclusion list.”[174]Boodles does not have an annual sustainability report and has not published information on human rights risks or supplier non-compliance beyond its “exclusion list.” It does not make public the names of its suppliers, with the exception of the Yanfolila gold mine in Mali. However, when asked about the timetable, the RJC assured Human Rights Watch that diamond and colored gemstone companies are expected to comply with the full five-step framework from 2021. Companies that have shared little or no information publicly or with Human Rights Watch are in a separate category due to nondisclosure.Most of the jewelry and watch companies featured in this report have strengthened their efforts to source responsibly since Human Rights Watch first assessed them in 2018. These companies have made it effectively impossible for jewelry companies that source from them to have full traceability.The London-based De Beers Group is one of the world’s largest diamond mining companies with an annual revenue of about $4.6 billion. [62] Indeed, companies that embrace responsible sourcing may be most likely to rebound successfully from the Covid-19 crisis, as consumers attach increasing importance to responsible business conduct.In response to widespread lockdowns and guidance from health authorities, global brands began closing their retail stores in China in January 2020 and, by mid-March, across most of Europe and North America. Some standards, such as the System of Warranties Guidelines for the diamond industry, clearly fall below international responsible business norms and compliance with them would still leave mining communities at risk of abuse. Instead of excluding artisanal suppliers from their supply chains, as many companies do, the jewelry industry should support efforts to formalize and professionalize artisanal mines and improve working conditions.Based on a company’s performance with regards to these criteria, we have indicated whether the company is taking excellent, strong, moderate, weak, or very weak steps towards responsible sourcing. In others, it means only that Chow Tai Food has traced the\\xa0diamond to a responsible supplier, but does not know the mine of origin.Human rights risk assessments and mitigation: Most companies that Human Rights Watch reviewed do not conduct robust, comprehensive human rights assessments or mitigation measures—including on-site visits—regarding conditions prevailing at the mines of origin. [176] Bulgari continues to take some important steps towards responsible sourcing and remains in the moderate category of Human Rights Watch’s ranking.In 2018, Bulgari adopted and made public a new Business Partner and Supplier Code of Conduct, with detailed requirements on human rights, as well as some more general provisions on environment and business integrity. © 2018 Centre for Natural Resource Governance ZimbabweDuring 2018 and 2019, private security officers employed by the state-owned Zimbabwe Consolidated Diamond Company (ZCDC) have used violence to deter local residents from mining diamonds, according to victims. Another reason is that some companies consider mere membership in an industry initiative—the RJC—a guarantee for responsible sourcing, even though this approach does not actually mean that they are conducting assessments.Some companies have taken small steps to better assess and manage human rights risks in their supply chains. [272] The company continues to take significant steps towards responsible sourcing and as in 2018, Human Rights Watch assesses its performance as strong.In 2019, Tiffany & Co. updated its Supplier Code of Conduct, adding or enhancing provisions related to young workers, freedom of association, engagement with host communities, traceability and due diligence, and grievance mechanisms. Of the companies that replied, Human Rights Watch also requested information regarding their response to the Covid-19 pandemic.The information provided in this report is based on information provided to Human Rights Watch directly from the companies, as well as publicly available information from company websites, annual reports, disclosure statements, and other public sources.Human Rights Watch assessed the companies based on the seven criteria below and evaluating what they were doing to achieve those objectives:In addition, Human Rights Watch believes that jewelry companies should make the extra effort to support and source from responsible artisanal and small-scale mines that respect human rights standards. [186] Cartier continues to take some important steps towards responsible sourcing and remains in the moderate category of Human Rights Watch’s ranking.Cartier has a corporate responsibility policy on business ethics, human rights, and environmental issues; in addition, its parent company has a more detailed Supplier Code of Conduct that applies to Cartier as well. [140]Overall, both the Fairmined and the Fairtrade standard are positive initiatives seeking to ensure responsible gold supply chains spanning from small-scale mine to jewelers. Several companies also increased transparency in reporting on their human rights due diligence.However, all of the companies assessed can and should take additional steps to ensure that their jewelry is not tainted by human rights abuses. [201] Therefore, gold from RJC sources is not automatically “ethical.”In the case of diamonds, Chopard says it is supporting the Kimberley Process and has put in place a “self-regulation” initiative but provides no details. [217] The company states that to ensure respect for human rights in its supply chains, it is adhering to international industry standards such as those set by the RJC, conducting regular human rights assessments of its suppliers, and is working to strengthen its anti-money laundering policies and procedures. At the same time, government monitoring and enforcement of mining and labor rights standards have been hampered by lockdowns.In producing countries, prices for minerals from small-scale mines have crashed because local traders faced difficulties in selling minerals abroad. [119] In addition, the Kimberley Process applies only to rough diamonds, allowing stones that are fully or partially cut and polished to fall outside the scope of the initiative.Despite much discussion over the need to reform the Kimberley Process, and a third periodic reform process starting in 2017, almost no progress has been made to change the definition to ensure diamonds are abuse-free. [179] For diamonds, Bulgari acknowledges that it is still very difficult to find mining companies who offer full traceability to mine level and acknowledges that this lack of traceability “represents a continuous improvement aspect for the entire industry.”[180]Bulgari has strong due diligence measures in place. [153] De Beers has several internal policies and a set of detailed requirements for its mines, other operations, and its contractors called the \"Best Practice Principles.”[154] Businesses to whom De Beers sells diamonds are both accredited buyers and so-called “sightholders,” including trading companies and manufacturers. [191] As a board member of the Swiss Better Gold Association, Cartier is involved in efforts to support responsible sourcing from artisanal gold mines, though it does not currently source from these mines. [239] The company has improved its responsible sourcing practices since 2018 and is now in the strong category of Human Rights Watch’s ranking.Pandora is a member of the RJC and spells out its requirements towards suppliers in its code of conduct. In addition, the Financial Action Task Force issued specific guidance documents on the diamond and gold supply chains. At the same time, some jewelry industry representatives have told Human Rights Watch that human rights due diligence remains a key component of successful business and that responsible business conduct is crucial, perhaps even more necessary, at times of a pandemic. [166] However, it operates several mines in each region and does not provide information on the individual mine of origin for its diamonds, but only on the region and in some cases subregion.Boodles is a family-owned luxury jeweler from the United Kingdom with over $100 million revenue in 2019. They are expected to put in place so-called human rights due diligence measures— that is, a process to identify, prevent, mitigate, and account for companies’ impacts on human rights—throughout their supply chain. [278]Tiffany & Co. states that 100 percent of its rough diamonds are sourced either directly from a known mine or from a supplier with a limited number of known mines,[279] and that 100 percent of its purchased raw gold was traceable to mines in the United States or from recycled sources. For the new standard, the RJC planned a protracted, multi-year rollout with extra time for diamond and gemstone companies, and a review by 2021 that could potentially lower the existing requirements. [182]The company states that it is committed to the Kimberley Process and the System of Warranties Guidelines and in 2019, sought to enhance human rights due diligence in the diamond supply chain through its “Bulgari Due Diligence Programme on the Responsible Sourcing of Diamonds.”[183] Under this program, Bulgari has enhanced checks on diamond suppliers through self-assessment questionnaires, more in-depth analysis of risks, and internal or external audits, including onsite audits. These standards are voluntary—they are not legally binding and companies can choose whether or not to adopt and join the initiative promoting them.While industry platforms should set the highest standard in the industry, they have often not done so, and in some cases fallen below existing international norms such as the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and the OECD Minerals Guidance, which should be treated as the minimum requirement. [73] Pandora guaranteed eight weeks’ salary for store employees after 90 percent of its stores were closed and—remarkably—maintained operations at its main manufacturing facility in Thailand, while instituting safety measures such as social distancing among workers. Materialytics has analyzed thousands of diamonds from 10 different countries and approximately 25 percent of the world’s diamond deposits and is currently working with several retailers to make the technology commercially available in early 2021. [196] The company has improved its responsible sourcing practices since 2018 and is now in the fair category of Human Rights Watch’s ranking.Chopard has a Code of Conduct for Partners but does not make it public.
